# üó∫Ô∏è Map Padding Fix

## Issue
The map section was initially rendering without proper padding at the top for the toolbar, causing the map controls to appear misaligned until the user interacted with the map (click and drag).

## Root Cause
1. The map controls were positioned with `top: calc(1.5rem + 100px)` which was inconsistent with the actual header height (90px)
2. Leaflet map needs to be notified about container size changes
3. Initial render timing issues with the map container

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Map Controls Position**
- Changed from `top: calc(1.5rem + 100px)` to `top: 1.5rem`
- This ensures controls are consistently positioned relative to the map container

### 2. **Added Map Size Invalidation**
- Added `mapInstanceRef.current.invalidateSize()` after 100ms delay
- This forces Leaflet to recalculate the map dimensions after initial render

### 3. **Added ResizeObserver**
- Monitors the map container for size changes
- Automatically calls `invalidateSize()` when container dimensions change
- Properly disconnects on component unmount

### 4. **Updated Map Container Styles**
- Changed `min-height` from `calc(100vh - 130px)` to `calc(100vh - 90px)` to match header height
- Added explicit `width: 100%` and `display: flex` for proper initial layout

### 5. **Added Canvas Renderer**
- Set `preferCanvas: true` and `renderer: L.canvas()` for better performance
- Helps with initial rendering consistency

## Technical Details

The fixes ensure that:
- Map initializes with correct dimensions on first render
- Controls are properly positioned without needing user interaction
- Map responds to container size changes automatically
- No visual glitches or jumps when the map loads

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/Map/Map.jsx` - Added invalidateSize, ResizeObserver, and canvas renderer
- `/src/components/Map/Map.module.css` - Fixed control positioning and container dimensions

The map should now render correctly on initial load without requiring any user interaction.
