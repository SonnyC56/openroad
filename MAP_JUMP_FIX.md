# üó∫Ô∏è Map Jump Fix - Ultra Solution

## Issue
The map was loading at the correct position initially, then quickly jumping up behind the top toolbar and staying there until clicked.

## Root Causes
1. **Double offset**: The `.main` container had both `margin-top: 90px` AND `height: calc(100vh - 90px)` 
2. **Scale animation**: The map container was animating from `scale: 0.95` to `scale: 1`, causing a layout shift
3. **Timing issues**: Map size calculations happening before the container was properly sized

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Layout Double Offset**
```css
/* Before - Double offset causing issues */
.main {
  height: calc(100vh - 90px);
  margin-top: 90px;
}

/* After - Clean single offset */
.main {
  height: 100vh;
  padding-top: 90px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### 2. **Removed Scale Animation**
```javascript
// Before - Scale animation causing layout shift
const mapVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, scale: 1 }
}

// After - Opacity only, no layout shift
const mapVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: { opacity: 1 }
}
```

### 3. **Improved Map Initialization**
- Added `whenReady()` callback to ensure map is fully loaded
- Used `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setTimeout`
- ResizeObserver now checks for valid dimensions before invalidating

### 4. **Removed glass-card Class**
- Removed potential additional styling that could affect layout

## Technical Explanation

The issue was a combination of:
1. CSS layout fighting between margin and height calculations
2. Animation causing the container to scale and shift the map
3. Map trying to calculate size before the container was stable

By using padding instead of margin, removing the scale animation, and ensuring proper initialization timing, the map now stays in the correct position from initial load.

## Files Modified
- `/src/App.css` - Changed from margin-top to padding-top approach
- `/src/components/Map/Map.jsx` - Removed scale animation, improved initialization
- `/src/components/Map/Map.module.css` - Removed min-height calculation

The map should now load smoothly without any jumping or position shifts.
