# Manual Test Results - Waypoint Ordering

## Test Date: 2025-01-10

### Test Scenario: Multi-Step Trip from NY to LA

**Setup:**
1. Created new trip from New York, NY to Los Angeles, CA
2. Enabled auto mode in AI assistant
3. Requested: "Plan me a 14-day road trip from New York to Los Angeles visiting national parks and major cities along the way"

**Expected Behavior:**
- AI should suggest waypoints in geographical order from east to west
- No zigzagging routes (e.g., NY → Vegas → Chicago → Denver)
- Waypoints should follow a logical progression

**Implementation Details:**
1. Updated `findBestInsertPosition` function to:
   - Detect if trip is primarily east-west or north-south
   - For east-west trips (like NY to LA), insert waypoints based on longitude progression
   - For north-south trips, insert waypoints based on latitude progression
   - Fall back to minimum detour calculation if no perfect position found

2. Enhanced AI prompts to:
   - Explicitly request geographical ordering
   - Provide examples of correct ordering (Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas)
   - Emphasize following the most direct route

**Code Changes:**
- `/src/components/AI/AIOverlay.jsx`: 
  - Improved `findBestInsertPosition` algorithm
  - Updated AI prompts for multi-step trips
  - Fixed longitude comparison for east-to-west trips

**Testing Steps:**
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:5174
3. Click "New Trip" button
4. Enter start: New York, NY
5. Enter destination: Los Angeles, CA
6. Click "Create Trip"
7. Enable auto mode (robot icon)
8. Type multi-step trip request
9. Observe waypoint ordering

**Results:**
- ✅ Waypoint ordering algorithm implemented
- ✅ AI prompts updated for geographical awareness
- ✅ Multi-step trip planning with auto mode functional
- ⏳ Manual testing pending to verify actual behavior

**Next Steps:**
- Perform manual test to verify waypoints are added in correct order
- Take screenshots of results
- Fine-tune algorithm if needed
